CodePath Facebook Assignment

Time spent: [10] hours

Completed user stories:
* [x] Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
* [x] Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
* [x] On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
* [x] If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.
* [x] Optional: The full screen photo should be zoomable.
* [ ] Optional: The user should be able to page through the other photos in full screen mode.

Notes: implemented optional regarding paging through other photos but need to fix bugs (zooming is not as expected and tap functionality on newsfeed is no longer behaving as expected). Those changes are in a separate branch that has not been merged to master.
